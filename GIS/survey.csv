I have occasionally inspected french drains at friend's houses and found most of them developing mosquito larvae. we do not have the manpower to inspect french drains at homes on a regular basis. rain barrel use is a fairly new thing in our area...the concern is that proper maintenance will become a problem. I have already seen rain barrels with the top screen removed because it quickly becomes clogged with debris from the gutters. we have a good handle on large structures like retention ponds, roadside ditches, roadside and off-road catch basins within the district. one rain garden established in a park by the village was just assumed that it would not develop mosquitoes. it is now one of the sources on our inspection/treatment routes.",,Paul,Geery,Assistant Manager/Biologist,DesPlaines Valley Mosquito Abatement District,8130 Ogden Avenue,P.O.Box 31,Lyons,Illinois,60534,U.S.A.,dvmosquito@sbcglobal.net,(708) 447-1765,(708) 447-1757,
